# Tree-Visualizer

Tree Visualizer is a platform or website where users, students and even teachers can test
their understanding and knowledge of trees and data structures. The user can visualize the
trees and check the operations performed on them with the help of animations and find if
it’s correct or not.

The values that the nodes can append are upto 4 digit values, so the number of a node
cannot be more than 9999. After inserting the node in the text field, the algorithms that we
have used for insertion of values in each tree will be applied and then the animations will
do the representation of the trees. It doesn’t matter at what kind of location the user wants
to visualize the trees as long as they are connected to the Internet.

Advantages:
• All the possible trees that are used in teaching data structures are present in one
website.
• The user doesn’t have to draw the figures manually, as it is time consuming.
• It provides an opportunity to expand your understanding of the subject with specific
technologies and exploring them in new contexts and ways.

You can use Tree Visualizer website or platform to perform four main actions or operations
on a tree:
• Insert -create a root node or append the new value into the existing tree.
• Delete-delete the existing node from the existing tree or created tree at that moment
by the user.
• Search/Find-apply searching algorithm to find the desired value in the tree and get
the value.
• Print-traverses through the complete tree and gives the values of the tree in in-order,
pre-order and post-order.
