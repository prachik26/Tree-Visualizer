        <h1><b>What is a B Tree?</b></h1>
        <p><img src="/images/images.png" alt="alt text" height="300" width="400" style="float: right">B Tree is a specialized m-way tree that can be widely used for disk access. 
            The need for B-Trees arose as a result of the growing need to reduce access times to physical storage media such as hard drives.
            Larger secondary storage devices are slower and we wanted these types of data structures to minimize disk access.

            Other data structures such as binary search trees, AVL trees, and red-black trees can only store one key per node. 
            If you need to store a large number of keys, the height of such a tree can become very large, resulting in long access times.</p>

        <h3><b>Properties of a B-tree</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>For each node x, the keys are stored in increasing order.</li>
            <li>If m is the order of the tree, each internal node can contain at most m - 1 keys along with a pointer to each child.</li>
            <li>Each node except root can have at most m children and at least m/2 children.</li>
            <li>All leaves have the same depth (i.e. height-h of the tree).</li>
            <li>The root has at least 2 children and contains a minimum of 1 key.</li>
            <li>If m ≥ 1, then for any m-key B-tree of height h and minimum degree t ≥ 2, h ≥ logt (m+1)/2.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3><b>Basic Operations on B-Tree</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Create: Creates an empty tree.</li>
            <li>Insert: Insert a node in the tree.</li>
            <li>Search: Searches for a node in the tree.</li>
            <li>Delete: Deletes a node from the tree.</li>
            <!-- <li>Traversal: Traverses through the tree in either inorder, preorder or postorder and prints the values or nodes of the tree.</li> -->
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3><b>Time Complexities</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Insertion:  O(log n)</li>
            <li>Deletion:  O(log n)</li>
            <li>Searching:  O(log n)</li>
            <p>Where  n  is the number of nodes in the BTree.</p>

    <h3>Delete Operation</h3>
    <p>There are three main cases for deletion operation in a B tree:

        <ul>
            <li>Case I - The key to be deleted lies in the leaf. There are two cases for it.</li>
            <ol type="circle">
                <li>The deletion of the key does not violate the property of the minimum number of keys a node should hold.</li>
                <li>The deletion of the key violates the property of the minimum number of keys a node should hold.</li>
                <p>In this case, we borrow a key from its immediate neighboring sibling node in the order of left to right.
        
                    First, visit the immediate left sibling. If the left sibling node has more than a minimum number of keys, then borrow a key from this node.
                    
                    Else, check to borrow from the immediate right sibling node.
                    
                    If both the immediate sibling nodes already have a minimum number of keys, then merge the node with either the left sibling node or the right sibling node. 
                    This merging is done through the parent node.</p>
            </ol>
            <li>Case II - If the key to be deleted lies in the internal node, the following cases occur:</li>
            <ol type="circle">
                <li>The internal node, which is deleted, is replaced by an inorder predecessor if the left child has more than the minimum number of keys.</li>
                <li>The internal node, which is deleted, is replaced by an inorder successor if the right child has more than the minimum number of keys.</li>
                <li>If either child has exactly a minimum number of keys then, merge the left and the right children. 
                    <p>After merging if the parent node has less than the minimum number of keys then, look for the siblings as in Case I.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <li>Case III</li>
            <p>In this case, the height of the tree shrinks. 
                If the target key lies in an internal node, and the deletion of the key leads to a fewer number of keys in the node (i.e. less than the minimum required), then look for the inorder predecessor and the inorder successor. 
                If both the children contain a minimum number of keys then, borrowing cannot take place. This leads to Case II(3) i.e. merging the children.</p>

        <h1>Applications:</h1>
            <ul>
                <li>B trees are used to index the data especially in large databases as access to data stored in large databases on disks is very time-consuming.</li>
                <li>Searching of data in larger unsorted data sets takes a lot of time but this can be improved significantly with indexing using B tree.</li>
            </ul>
        
    
        <h1>Advantages:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Keeps keys in sorted order for sequential traversing</li>
            <li>Uses a hierarchical index to minimize the number of disk reads</li>
            <li>Uses partially full blocks to speed up insertions and deletions</li>
            <li>Keeps the index balanced with a recursive algorithm</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Disadvantages:</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>The major drawback of B-tree is the difficulty of traversing the keys sequentially.</li>
        </ul>
